# Full Proposal

Based on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qPt0NWDIBmZ10F9bsWPGbDeZfy6pl2k177fV4jSoddo/edit#bookmark=id.7hw0titrpfvh.

## Project Purpose

We will create and pilot a 12-hours long open curriculum in Portuguese in Florianópolis, Brazil, covering Python and targeting Oceanography, Biology, Geosciences
and Meteorology researchers who are looking to be more efficient and open by using Python to automate part of their research.

The purpose of our project is to help Brazilian Oceanography, Biology, Geosciences and Meteorology researchers, PhD students and undergraduate students
on their adoption of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in their research and in turn help them enter the world of Open Science.

We will achieve this aim by creating a 12-hours-long Python Curriculum, in Portuguese, focused on the above areas, and by leveraging local
[Research Software Engineer](http://rse.ac.uk/what-is-an-rse/) champions who will help deliver a trial of the developed curriculum.

## Describe the issue/problem you are trying to address

### Background

Melissa Weber Mendonça is a Professor at [Federal University of Santa Catarina](http://ufsc.br)'s Mathematics department since 2010. As a mathematical
programming and scientific computing teacher and researcher, she has collaborated with the Oceanography department of her home institution for the last 3 years.
In 2016, she co-organized and taught a [Python workshop for Oceanographers and Biologists](https://github.com/melissawm/oceanobiopython). At the time, the demand for the workshop was very high: there were 30 participant slots available and more than 100 people registered to take part in it. The Oceanography
department was interested in organizing it again, this time with a more specialized focus on applications related to Oceanography and Geosciences.

Many scientists in Brazil are not using Python because most universities teach MATLAB as the main tool for analysis and other computational applications. However,
there is a general understanding that using a proprietary system is not ideal for Open Science, and there is a great interest in Python as a language.
Unfortunately, teaching materials in Portuguese are still scarce, especially for people who are not particularly skilled in programming. Not having materials
in Portuguese is one of the barriers to enter the computer field as mentioned by Andy Oram at [Open Source in Brazil](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/open-source-in-brazil.csp).
This project aims to reduce the barriers described above by financing a five days lesson curriculum creation sprint.
The new curriculum will be available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license
allowing more students and researchers Portuguese speakers to benefit from this project.

## List key project activities (what will you do), outputs (what will be produced through your activities, e.g. products, publications, number of workshops held and people trained) and outcomes (impact of your project on your beneficiaries during the grant period).

In this project, we will

- Coordinate a lesson curriculum creating sprint;
- Release a lesson curriculum covering the basics of Python and related libraries for Oceanography, Biology, Geosciences and Meteorology;
- Run a 12-hour pilot workshop using the curriculum.

For the Lesson Curriculum Creation Sprint,
We will invite and coordinate a group of 10 professors, researchers, research software engineers, software developers and educators to create, during 9-13 April,
a curriculum, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, for scientific Python and tools relevant to the areas mentioned above. The curriculum will be designed to educate mostly grad students but will be suitable for senior researchers and last year undergraduate students.

The working group will be lead by Melissa Weber Mendonça and Juliana Leonel, two full-time professors at the Federal Univesity of Santa Catarina.
Melissa and Juliana will host the sprint in Florinópolis, Brazil
to increase the engagement of their local community.
As external specialists, Melissa and Juliana will invite Filipe Fernandes, Tania Allard, and Alejandra Gonzalez Beltran.

Filipe Fernandes is a long time open source developer working in Oceanography. FIXME

Tania Allard is a Research Software Engineer with experience developing lesson content for the OpenDreamKit project as well a for OOOMinds, a Leverhulme fellowship project.
Tania has significant experience working on multi-disciplinary projects as well as in data and software engineering.
As a research software engineer she is particularly involved in the development of complex data analysis workflows as well as adequate data curation and preservation strategies.
She is particularly interested in the reproducible and replicable scientific research and thus has working experience in developing standards and tools for researchers and data scientists
to ensure best practices in their workflows while maximising their research impact.
In addition, she has over 8 years teaching experience at different levels of education and has taken courses in pedagogy and teaching methodologies.

Alejandra Gonzalez Beltran is a Research Lecturer at the Oxford e-Research Centre, Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford.
Alejandra has experience data science and software engineering, including expertise on data standards and knowledge management working on multi-disciplinary
domains, including biomedical sciences and computer science. She also has vast experience in teaching in different levels of education, is a Carpentry Instructor and will complete the Instructor Trainer
training in early 2018. Alejandra's background is in Computer Science, having received a Licentiateship in Computer Science (would be equivalent to an MSc)
from National University of Rosario, Argentina and a PhD in Computer Science from Queen's University Belfast, UK.

After the sprint,
the authors will continue to collaborate on GitLab
polishing the curriculum
until the planned release at the end of July 2018.
Before the release,
Raniere Silva,
Aleksandra Pawlik
and
Renato Augusto Corrêa dos Santos
will review the curriculum, provide feedback and suggest amendments to the
content and delivery structure of the materials
based on their previous experiences providing training to researchers and academics.


The pilot workshop will be hosted at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in August 2018.
40 seats will be offered to Oceanography, Biology, Geosciences and Meteorology researchers.
These seats will be assigned via an open call, which will be disseminated using appropriate channels (e.g. university mailing list, social media, partners websites).
The application submitted during the open call will be reviewed and the seats
will be assigned on a fair and inclusive basis.
The pilot workshop will be free of charge to learners
and at the end, we will host a dinner to collect feedback.

After the pilot included in this proposal, the chairs of this proposal will continue to improve the curriculum and deliver it in different formats at
their home institution. Initially, this would include a 12-hour workshop offered every semester, and a possibly shorter version to be offered at Oceanography conferences.
There is also a demand for the inclusion of this course or some variation of it as a permanent semester-long course in the Oceanography department, and maybe others. The curriculum will be modified accordingly so that it addresses domain specific demands, and thus making it more meaningful for the attendees.
There are also plans to release the same material in other languages, such as English and Spanish.

With this project, we will encourage students and researchers in Oceanography, Biology, Geosciences and Meteorology to use open source tools and follow open science best practices. This will, in the long term, allow them to maximise the impact of their research as well as increasing their collaborations by working in the open.

## Provide key indicators you plan to use to measure project outcomes and source of data.

Outcomes for this type of project are hard to measure.
David F. Feldon et al. wrote "[Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1705783114)"
saying that the effects of training like the one we are proposing are null.
We disagree with David F. Feldon et al. and Karen R. Word et al. wrote "[When Do Workshops Work?](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/reponse-to-null-effects/)",
a blog post response to David F. Feldon et al. paper.
We will collect pre and post-workshop survey from the attendees of the 12-hour pilot workshop we will run.
The collected data will be compared with [data available in the literature](https://carpentries.github.io/assessment/carpentries/long-term-survey/report.html)
to assess the pilot and create a list of future changes.
If we obtain funds to continue the project after the initial 6 months,
we will collect a survey of the attendees after 6 months and 1 year of the pilot workshop.

## Explain who will benefit from the project and how you will engage with them.

The primary group to benefit from the project will be students and researchers in Oceanography, Biology, Geosciences and Meteorology from the Federal University of Santa Catarina.
The secondary group to benefit from the project will be students and researchers on the subjects mention before that speak Portuguese.
Because the curriculum developed as part of this project will be open source,
we envision that it will be used by self-learners as well as by study groups in universities based in Brazil and other Portuguese speak countries.
Members of our primary beneficiary group will be invited to participate in the lesson curriculum creating sprint and on the 12-hour pilot workshop using the curriculum.
As mention below,
we will have
a Telegram group (?) and
a Facebook group (?)
to keep the contributors engaged.

## Describe the geographic location(s) in which this project will be implemented.

"Python workshop for Oceanographers and Biologists" will be implemented at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil.
The university was funded in 1960 and in 2016 it had around 45k students in their undergraduate and graduate programmes.
Florianópolis is the capital of the state of Santa Catarina, in the South region of Brazil.
It is composed of one main island, Santa Catarina Island, a continental part and surrounding small islands.
It has a population of around 477k, the 47th most populous city in Brazil.
The economy of Florianópolis is heavily based on information technology, tourism and services.
A considerable percentage of the information technology workforce in Florianópolis
was trained at the Federal University of Santa Catarina
which will potentialize the impact of our project in the long term.

## List any risks or challenges that may affect the overall success of your project and note how Mozilla and/or others can help you to overcome these challenges.

## List your project partners if any, and the role they will play in the project.

## Mozilla works in the open. How will you document and share your project progress with the community?

The whole process of discussing and writing this proposal as done in the open on GitLab, https://gitlab.com/rgaiacs/mozilla-science-lab-mini-grant-2018-florianopolis/.
We will continue to use GitLab as the central point of collaboration between the ones involved in this proposal,
including for the development of the curriculum that we proposed.
To share the project we will create
a website,
a Telegram group (?),
a Facebook group (?)
and some print material.
The graphic material created for the project will be available in GitLab.

## Are other organizations working toward outcomes similar to those described in this proposal? If yes, explain how your work complements that of others or fills a key gap.

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
develop and teach domain specific, from life and physical sciences to social science, lessons
on the fundamental software development and data skills needed to conduct research.
Their initial target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience,
same as ours.
Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry don't have a lesson on (?)
and our proposal will fill this gap with the possibility of being reused by them.
Raniere Silva is serving on their Executive Council which will ensure a close relationship.

Renato Augusto Corrêa dos Santos has been organising some local activities to teach biologists
to code in his local community. Renato will be one of the reviewers of the curriculum
and might use it in his future workshops.
