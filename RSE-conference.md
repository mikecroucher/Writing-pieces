# RSE Sheffield in the 2nd RSE conference

The second RSE conference took place on the 7th and 8th of September 2017 at the
Museum of Science and Industry [MOSI](https://www.msimanchester.org.uk/).
There were over 200 attendees, 40 talks, and 15 discussion and hands-on workshops,
3 keynote talks, one of which was given by our very own head honcho Mike Croucher
(slides [here](https://mikecroucher.github.io/RSE_2017_keynote_presentation/)), and geeky chats galore.

RSE team members Mozghan and Tania were involved in the organising committee as talks co-chairs and diversity chair (disclose: they had nothing to do with Mike's keynote). Also, all of the RSE Sheffield team members made it to the conference, which seems to be a first due to the diverse commitments and project involvements of all of us

## Conference highlights

With so many parallel sessions, workshops, and chats happening all at the same time it is quite complicated to keep a track of every single thing going on. And it seems rather unlikely that this will change over time as it was **evident** that the RSE community has outgrown the current conference size... in just 2 years!
So we decided to highlight our favorites of the event:

 - The talk on 'Imposter syndrome' [need to insert speaker], which tends to be a common feeling of our community members, and the scientific community overall. So many delegates were immediately drawn to this talk and felt identified with stories and examples provided.

- Another talk that seemed to have gathered loads of interest was that of
[Toby Hodges](https://twitter.com/tbyhdgs) from  EMBL on community building. This makes complete sense to us as RSEs are often in charge of building communities or acting as a bridge between collaborating communities. Opposed to _just_ develop code and sitting in front of a computer.

- During the first day the RSEs had the chance to have a go at interacting with the [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/hololens). Everyone seemed to be having a great time doing so... unfortunately we did not have the chance to try it ourselves

- Tania Allard's hands-on workshop on 'Jupyter notebooks for reproducible research', which turned out to be one of the workshops with the highest interest from the community and had to be run twice!

- [any others?]

## Our workshop on reproducible research
The team members at RSE Sheffield are greatly interested in open source software, working in the open, reproducibility, and replicability in science. And as such, we are advocates for software best and sustainable practices within the University of Sheffield and the wider RSE community.
