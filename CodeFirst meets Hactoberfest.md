#CodeFirstGirls meets Hacktoberfest

It is that time of the year again! The autumn-winter courses for
[CodeFirst: girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/)
are in full swing at Sheffield, Manchester and many other locations all
 over the UK.

As the lead instructor of the Python courses part of my 'job' is to make sure
that everything runs smoothly and that the gals make the most of the course.
Since the courses run only over 8 weeks and we have loads of ground to cover I decided to
improve the way we, the instructors communicate and plan the course as well as how we deliver the
contents for the course.

## Implementation
- **GitHub**: I use Git and GitHub all the time for all my projects and tasks. So it only made sense to make it a central point of contact as well as the main place for all the additional material to be kept into. It has worked wonders, all of the organisation stuff is there, we make sure that the additional materials developed by us are peer-reviewed and it makes it makes all of our lives easier.
- **GitKraken**: ok ok I know many people would prefer teaching Git using the command line, but I have used both command line and GUI approaches and I think you first need to know your audience to better understand which approach to use. In this case GitKraken was my weapon of choice... powerful, intuitive and did I say beutiful? Yes suitable for visual learners.
- **Learning by doing**: I am a firm believer of learning by doing. It sometimes is the best approach to get the grips of things. How do you make the git-add-commit-push a natural habit? Exactly, by doing it over and over again.
