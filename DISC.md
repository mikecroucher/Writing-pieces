# Diversity in Scientific Computing Unconference + PyData

This post corresponds to the last of a series of events I attended over 2017. It has been a good year and I am sure you have already have a good idea of what I have been up to thanks to this blog.
This time I am writing about the very first Diversity in Scientific Computing Unconference and PyData organised by [NUMFocus](https://numfocus.org). These semi-parallel events ran from the 26th to the 30th of January in New York City, more precisely at Microsoft headquarters.

# PyData 26-28th November

As the name suggest this event was dedicated to all things #PyData, following a familiar conference setup: keynotes, talks, lightning talks, and workshops (which I did not attend as I was attending DISC during the last two days of the event).
