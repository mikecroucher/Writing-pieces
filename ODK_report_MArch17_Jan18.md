## Achievements

- Supported a number of lecturers in Sheffield to migrate to Jupyter and CoCalc
(formerly SageMathCloud). Also, provided continued support to those that ad already been using CoCalc and
Jupyter notebooks for their courses.
These included lecturers from Computer Science, Physics, Biomedical
Science, Bioinformatics, and Materials Science.
- The previously generated CoCalc tutorial was extended by adding tutorial
sections for students having courses in CoCalc as well as with a hands-on
tutorial for lecturers to get started. The material can be found as a website at [https://tutorial.cocalc.com/](https://tutorial.cocalc.com/) (The repository for this is located at:[https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc_tutorial](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc_tutorial)).
- Widened dissemination activities.
- Mike Croucher's EPSRC fellowship is expanding pur agenda and remit nationwide.
- Developed a [Jekyll template](https://github.com/trallard/Modules-template)
for use by academics and researchers using Jupyter notebooks for course materials and dissemination.
- Developed a Python package:  [nbjekyll](https://github.com/trallard/nbjekyll) that complements the Jekyll template developed.
This package converts Jupyter notebooks into .md files that can be readily usable by Jekyll. It also uses nbval to perform notebook validation and add custom headers indicating the last update date, version and test status of the notebook.

## Work in progress

- Involvement in the Machine Learning Network: working with the Machine Learning group at Sheffield to leverage the use of Jupyter notebooks and related technologies (e.g. code cafe, coding dojos)
- Development of an online journal based on Jupyter notebook submissions and with a content review performed in GitHub (the first volume will be generated from a sprint/hackathon)
- Development of a data analytics course for women and individuals that identify themselves as women.

## Workshops and dissemination activities

- Workshop on Jupyter notebooks for reproducible research (RSE conference September 2017, [https://github.com/trallard/JNB_reproducible](https://github.com/trallard/JNB_reproducible))
- Blog post on the RSE conference and workshop was published in the [RSE Sheffield blog](www.rse.shef.ac.uk/blog) and reposted in the [Software Carpentries Blog](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/01/rse-conf-repost.html).
- Bioinformatics Awareness Days [https://github.com/trallard/BAD_days](https://github.com/trallard/BAD_days)
- Developed training materials and provided training for over 95 women in the last 12 months at Sheffield and Manchester in partnership with CodeFirstGirls
- Participation in the Diversity and Inclusion in Scientific Computing unconference by direct invite of NUMFOCUS
